I2C Map
----------

I2C bus is bit-banged by the CPU on VIA #1 GPIO ports PA0 (SDA) and PA1 (SCL).

There are two slave devices on the bus:
* SMC (System Management Controller) on the 7-bit (unshifted) I2C address 0x42
* Real-Time Clock (RTC) chip MCP7940N on the 7-bit (unshifted) I2C address 0x6F

SMC I2C Slave registers:

        Register 	Value 	Description
        $01 	    $00 	Power off
        $01 	    $01 	Hard reboot
        $02 	    $00 	Inject RESET
        $03 	    $00 	Inject NMI
        $04 	    00..FF 	Power LED brightness
        $05 	    00..FF 	Activity LED brightness
        $08                 debug: set echo_byte // read echo_byte
        $09                 debug: print echo_byte

        $07 	    - 	    Read from keyboard buffer (.ino:264)
        $18 	    - 	    Read ps2 status  //Get keyboard command status (.ino:278: ret Keyboard.getCommandStatus() 
                                            -> PS2_CMD_STATUS: IDLE = 0,  CMD_PENDING = 1,   CMD_ACK = 0xFA,  CMD_ERR = 0xFE)
        $19 	00..FF 	    Send ps2 command: //Send command to keyboard (one byte) (.ino:251)
        $1A                 //Send command to keyboard (two bytes) (.ino:255) ** not documented!
        
        $21 	    - 	    Read from mouse buffer: //Get mouse packet (.ino:281) -- ret 3B or 0
